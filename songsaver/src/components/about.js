            This is the first React project I have ever made! <br /> 
            And to be honest I am not a big fan of React despite its popularity. 
            <br/>
            Unlike some other frameworks it feels far too different from normal JavaScript 
            <br/>
            in how you are supposed to work with it.
            <br/> <br/>
            The project itself was however a nice way to learn React, 
            but it was also a source of frustration.
            <br/>
            Because as I said I am not a fan of React and some things were much harder to do than I 
            anticipated
